I failed two Google interviews over the years. Then before the third one, I had a dream. I would have to pick between two jobs.

Next day at work the phone rang. Google recruiter asked if I would like to interview with Google. I said sure. A short conversation. I hang up the phone, turned to my coworker and told him “Google is going to offer me a job”. He said “OK, but you are not going anywhere”.

In our IBM office in South San Jose, I looked out the window and looked at the beautiful hills and wondered myself if I wanted to go anywhere.

on process a coworker from IBM who has joined Google earlier told me “Look, in Google my day is bad if the ice cream machine is broken, you have much bigger problems in IBM. You should join Google.” Now whenever I find the ice cream machine broken, I remember that he was right.

Then in the next round a guy came and said “What would you do if I told you I was completely unprepared”. I told him I can ask the questions and he can make a decision based on what I am talking about. He said “No no” and asked a question for which I did not know the answer. I Googled this question and it turns out a team of researchers wrote a paper about it. Unless I already know the answer, how the hell am I supposed to solve it standing in front of a whiteboard? I struggled without a clear algorithm, but a vague idea that could not be coded yet. My solution had many optimization ideas along with a discussion of low level data locality, multi threading options etc. But it was not quite what he wanted. Then he asked whether we can do what he wanted. I told him “yes, we can do”. My intuition told me it was doable. “But I could not do it yet”.

I got there on time, just before 10am. After a short while I was standing in the meeting room, he was writing the interview question on the board. I recognized the question. It was something they asked me earlier, but I did not know the answer. I did not like the question, thus I did not even Google for it after previous interview. I felt things did not add up. How could they offer me a job if I can’t answer this question? As I was hopelessly watching the question unfold on whiteboard, he turned to me and he said “If we ask you a question we have asked before, tell us and we will change it”. I told him I recognize this question and they have asked me before. He said OK, and he proceeded to ask another question.

If he did not point to it, I would think they are testing me with the exact same question and I would not have told that they have already asked it.

I gave an answer to his new question which came with a long discussion / thought process. I don’t know if it was the best answer. Never Googled the question later.


During the decision process a coworker from IBM who has joined Google earlier told me “Look, in Google my day is bad if the ice cream machine is broken, you have much bigger problems in IBM.
